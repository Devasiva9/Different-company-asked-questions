Background:
An automobile company manufactures both two-wheelers (TW) and four-wheelers (FW). A manager needs to determine the production quantities of both vehicle types based on specific data inputs.

Problem Statement:
Given the total number of vehicles (two-wheelers + four-wheelers) and the total number of wheels, your task is to find out how many two-wheelers and four-wheelers need to be manufactured according to the following constraints:

Each two-wheeler has 2 wheels.
Each four-wheeler has 4 wheels.
Input:
Two positive integers separated by a new line:
The first input line contains the total number of vehicles, V (two-wheelers + four-wheelers).
The second input line contains the total number of wheels, W.
Constraints:
The total number of wheels W must be:
Greater than or equal to 2 (W >= 2).
An even number (W % 2 == 0).
The total number of vehicles V must be greater than 0 (V > 0).
The total number of wheels must be at least double the total number of vehicles (W >= 2 * V).
Output:
If the input does not meet the constraints, print:
"INVALID INPUT"
example:
200
540
Two Wheelers = 130
Four Wheelers = 70
